    	<h2><sub>By: James Whatley</sub></h2>
			<p>Alligators are native to the Southeastern United States and China.  They are solitary territorial reptiles who are deadly both in and out of water.  American Alligators live in freshwater and brackish ponds, rivers, and swamps.  The Chinese Alligator is only found near the Yangtze River.</p>

		 <p>Large alligators, male or female, are less tolerant of other alligators than their smaller counterparts.  The alligator may use its short bursts of land speed to catch prey, or will sneak up on them in the water.</p>
		 <p>People are often afraid of alligators or too careless around them.  This is due to the alligators' relative fear of humans. People may approach the nests to mess with alligators and in turn, force the alligator to attack them.  Learn more about alligators in order to stop this senseless fear.</p>
